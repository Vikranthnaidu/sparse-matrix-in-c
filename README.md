Implementation of Sparse Matrix with C
This code is for performing operations on sparse matrices using linked lists. A sparse matrix is a matrix that has many zero elements and only a few non-zero elements. A linked list is a data structure that stores data in nodes that are connected by pointers. Each node in the linked list represents a non-zero element of the sparse matrix and contains its value, row position, column position and a pointer to the next node. The code has functions for reading values from the user, creating nodes for the non-zero elements, adding, subtracting and multiplying two sparse matrices, displaying the sparse matrix and the linked list, and destroying the linked list. The main function has a menu-driven loop that allows the user to choose an option and perform the corresponding operation on the sparse matrices.
